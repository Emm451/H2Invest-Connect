# Project Title

InvestAI Connect: AI Platform for Hydrogen Sector Investors
Building AI course project

## Summary

InvestAI Connect aims to facilitate connections between qualified investors and innovative projects in the hydrogen sector, driving the transition to clean energy.

## Background

InvestAI Connect addresses the challenge of connecting investors with promising hydrogen projects, which is a significant barrier to the growth of this industry. This problem is becoming increasingly prevalent as the interest in hydrogen as a clean energy source rises. My personal motivation stems from the urgency to accelerate the transition to sustainable energy solutions.

## How is it used?

The platform acts as a matchmaking service, utilizing AI algorithms to match qualified investors with viable hydrogen projects. Entrepreneurs seeking investments and investors looking for opportunities in the hydrogen field will use this platform. The solution is needed in situations where accessing reliable investors for hydrogen projects is challenging.

## Data sources and AI methods

Data for the platform will be sourced from various databases containing information about investors, hydrogen projects, and global energy market trends. Natural language processing and machine learning techniques will be employed for investor and project profiling and matching.

## Challenges

The platform does not solve regulatory complexities or specific risks associated with hydrogen projects. Ethical considerations regarding data privacy and security must be taken into account when deploying such a solution.

## What next?

InvestAI Connect could expand to include real-time market analysis, offer funding suggestions, and establish strategic partnerships for selected projects. Collaboration with experts in AI and energy sectors could help further develop the platform's capabilities.
